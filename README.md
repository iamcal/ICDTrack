# ICDTrack - Track trinket proc ICDs

This text-only addon is useful for calculating the ICD of trinket procs.

To start tracking a cooldown, you'll need the spell ID fo the prod from wowhead. If you wanted to test the Heroic Starcatcher Compass, you'd find it on wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/item=77993) and then click on the buff (http://www.wowhead.com/spell=109712). Then you start tracking it:

    /icd start 109712

As it procs, it will show you the time between procs and let you know when it sees a new best time.
